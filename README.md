### TIC-TAC-TOE ### 
This is a Python implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using PyGame. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to search 
for the optimal next move within a search space that includes all possible outcomes subsequent to the current state of the 
game, except for the first move (if AI plays as X). Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a solved game (always ends in a draw if both players 
play optimally), if the AI has the first turn, it will place in one of the corners as it has been shown to be the optimal
first move. 
To play the game, run game.py.
